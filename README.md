# Frontend Mentor - Intro component with sign up form solution

This is a solution to the [Intro component with sign up form challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/intro-component-with-signup-form-5cf91bd49edda32581d28fd1)

## Built with

-   HTML5
-   CSS
-   Next.js

### What I learned

This challenge really pushed me to rethink my layouts and to use grid for my major layouts instead of just flexbox. This solved multiple issues and allowed me to reduce the number of lines in my CSS.

This challenge also allowed me to start practising my JS again and start to use common patterns found in other front end projects.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
